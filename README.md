CubeSensors for PHP
===================

A PHP library for the  [CubeSensors API](http://my.cubesensors.com/docs)

Usage
----

The library inherits the style of many OAuth libraries, like Abraham's TwitterOAuth library.

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to import the package:
```
"require": {
	"php": ">=5.4.0",
	"lgladdy/cubesensors": "v2.0.1" // Or "dev-master" if you want the latest code.
}
```

You can then import in your own PHP file if you want to go down that route:
```
  require "vendor/autoload.php";
  use lgladdy\CubeSensors\CubeSensors;
```

Alternatively, (or probably additionally!) check out /demo for an example of how the code should work (You'll need to copy /demo/config.dist.php to config.php and fill in the correct consumer keys you get from the "Your Apps" page on [my.cubesensors.com](my.cubesensors.com).)

Todo
----
Write tests.
